# 32-bit MIPS Single-Cycle Processor

# Overview

This project implements a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor in VHDL. It supports a subset of the MIPS instruction set, executing each instruction in a single clock cycle.

# Features

Single-cycle architecture \ 

Implements key MIPS instructions (R-type, I-type, and basic J-type) \ 

32-bit data path \ 

Separate instruction and data memories \ 

Support for ALU operations, memory access, and branching
